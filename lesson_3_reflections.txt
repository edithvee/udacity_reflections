When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I were collaborating on a project, or if I were using more than
one machine, I would probably want to remote.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up to date with your remote repository?

It might not be a logical place to update at?
