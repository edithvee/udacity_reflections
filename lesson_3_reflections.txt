When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I were collaborating on a project, or if I were using more than
one machine, I would probably want to remote.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up to date with your remote repository?

It might not be a logical place to update at?



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are for different features in one repository.
They're good for experimenting while keeping the master branch
alive and well and fully functional.

Clones are straight copies of a repository at whatever time
it was cloned.
You would want to clone a repository onto a local to edit
and then push the changes to a remote, especially if collaborating.

Forks are exactly like clones except that
1) they're inside of GitHub (once you copy to local it's a clone, I think?)
2) they link to the GitHub repository from which it was copied.
I would use this to credit someone else,
and clone/push if it was my or a collaborator's project.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
of the remote stored locally?

I'd be able to see whether the remote has a conflict with
what I'm working on, or save me from duplicating work?
