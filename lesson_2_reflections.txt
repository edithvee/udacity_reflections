What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a git repo adds a .git file to the existing repo.
This file I htink contains th metadata and history of 
tracked files within the repo.
You need to do it in order to change the repo from a regular 
folder into a git repo in which files may be tracked.



How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is closer to the git repository than the 
working directory, but is not yet a commit.
Its use is in that it allows one to track changes to a file 
that may be planned to be part of a commit but ends up not 
being logically connected to the change made.
It also means not everly literal thing needs to be included 
in every commit, eg background files/libraries etc that can be 
assumed as given.



How can you use the staging area to make sure 
you have one commit per logical change?

By running diffs between the staging area and the repository, 
and between the working directory and the staging area, 
it should be spotted if changes that belong together 
haven't been staged together, or if changes that don't belong 
together have.
